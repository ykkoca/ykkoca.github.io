I am a PhD candidate in the Economics department of the University of Southern California. My main research interests are labor economics and macroeconomics.

## Research

### [AI Automation and Labor Market Outcomes](/files/jmp_YakupKutsal_Koca.pdf)

There are many predictions regarding occupational AI exposure, but existing measures typically fail to account for worker reallocation and its resulting economic impacts. Hence, exposure measures do not necessarily translate into economic impact. An exposed worker can mitigate wage losses by switching to the next best occupation. On the other hand, this switch creates new competition for the incumbent workers in the next-best occupation. To model these reallocation effects and their impact on equilibrium wages, I build a framework where production can be performed by human workers or by AI technology. I then estimate a model of occupation choice where workers are heterogeneous in terms of their comparative advantage across occupations. Using automation scores, I simulate an AI shock to occupational prices, and then solve for the  equilibrium after the workers reallocate. Given that AI shock is uneven across occupations, results suggest that \textit{generalists}, i.e. workers with uniform comparative advantages fare better, whereas \textit{specialists} experience worse outcomes.

## Work in Progress

### Measuring Limited Mobility Bias

Limited mobility bias yields overestimation of firm effects in earnings models where the income is assumed to be sum of worker and firm effects. While this bias is attempted to be corrected by statistical methods, I aim to measure this bias by looking at the cases with high mobility, such as mass layoffs. With a matched employer-employee data, I focus on the tech layoffs during 2023 and 2024.
