I am a PhD candidate in the Economics department of the University of Southern California. My main research interests are macroeconomics and labor economics.

## Research

### Labor Market Outcomes of AI Automation 

*First draft coming soon*

AI automation is a central issue for the labor market, and the purpose of this study is to look at the effects of AI automation on employment and wage distribution. While there are studies that concern how exposed the occupations are to AI technologies, I take into account the worker redistribution that comes with workers being replaced by AI. I use a model of labor supply to determine the income, as well as the latent productivity variable that is required to estimate a worker's income across all occupations.

## Work in Progress

### Measuring Limited Mobility Bias

Limited mobility bias yields overestimation of firm effects in earnings models where the income is assumed to be sum of worker and firm effects. While this bias is attempted to be correcte by statistical methods, I aim to measure this bias by looking at the cases with high mobility, such as mass layoffs. With a matched employer-employee data, I focus on the tech layoffs during 2023 and 2024.
